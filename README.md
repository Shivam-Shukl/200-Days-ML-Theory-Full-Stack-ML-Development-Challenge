## üî• About This Challenge

As a passionate learner aiming to become an **industry-ready ML Engineer / Data Scientist**, I realized that learning in theory isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî real impact comes from **building**, **sharing**, and **learning in public**.

So I started this 200-day challenge to:
- Master ML/DL theory
- Build **real-world, end-to-end ML apps**
- Learn MLOps, deployment, and best practices
- Prepare for interviews and future job roles

üì¢ **Note**: I'm still a beginner in many areas. This repo is my space to grow, improve, and share openly. Please don‚Äôt judge ‚Äî instead, feel free to help me learn üôè
