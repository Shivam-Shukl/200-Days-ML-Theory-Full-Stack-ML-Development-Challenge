# 🚀 200 Days ML Theory + Full-Stack ML Development Challenge

Welcome to my personal learning journey:  
**200 Days of Machine Learning (ML) Theory + Full-Stack ML Development**  
📅 Duration: [Start Date] – [End Date]  
🏷️ Hashtag: `#200DaysMLChallenge`

## 🔥 About This Challenge

As a passionate learner aiming to become an **industry-ready ML Engineer / Data Scientist**, I realized that learning in theory isn’t enough — real impact comes from **building**, **sharing**, and **learning in public**.

So I started this 200-day challenge to:
- Master ML/DL theory
- Build **real-world, end-to-end ML apps**
- Learn MLOps, deployment, and best practices
- Prepare for interviews and future job roles

📢 **Note**: I'm still a beginner in many areas. This repo is my space to grow, improve, and share openly. Please don’t judge — instead, feel free to help me learn 🙏
